          <p>
            Wabiz, a product of Damcorp and a subsidiary of Mcash, operates in the WhatsApp API sector alongside its parent company. Unlike Damcorp, which offers tailored services, Wabiz provides a self-service, subscription-based model with a pay-as-you-go structure. This allows users to easily manage their WhatsApp API needs with flexibility and autonomy.          </p>
          <p>
            Leveraging the technological expertise of Damcorp and Mcash, Wabiz delivers scalable, high-quality communication solutions. Its self-service approach offers a more adaptable alternative to traditional service models, catering to the diverse needs of its users.          </p>
